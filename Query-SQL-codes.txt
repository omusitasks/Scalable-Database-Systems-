SQL Queries:
1. Display all available vehicles on a given date: 
SELECT * FROM Vehicle WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Reservation WHERE Vehicle.vehicle_id = Reservation.vehicle_id 
AND Reservation.expected_departure_date = <given date>);

2. Display how many vehicles each department has used so far: 
SELECT Department.name, COUNT(Reservation.vehicle_id) AS number_of_vehicles_used 
FROM Reservation 
INNER JOIN Department ON Reservation.department_id = Department.id
GROUP BY Department.name;

3. Display the total mileage driven by a department this year: 
SELECT Department.name, SUM(Checkout.odometer_reading_end - Checkout.odometer_reading_start) AS total_mileage_driven 
FROM Checkout 
INNER JOIN Reservation ON Checkout.reservation_id = Reservation.id 
INNER JOIN Department ON Reservation.department_id = Department.id 
WHERE YEAR(Checkout.date) = <given year> 
GROUP BY Department.name;

4. Show details of a particular bill: 
SELECT * 
FROM Trip_Completion 
INNER JOIN Checkout ON Trip_Completion.checkout_id = Checkout.id 
INNER JOIN Reservation ON Checkout.reservation_id = Reservation.id 
WHERE Trip_Completion.bill_id = <given bill id>;

5. Display those who booked vehicles but not actually used them: 
SELECT Reservation.faculty_name 
FROM Reservation 
LEFT JOIN Checkout ON Reservation.id = Checkout.reservation_id 
WHERE Checkout.id IS NULL;
